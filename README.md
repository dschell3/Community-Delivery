## About This Project

A coordination platform connecting immigrants with local volunteers for grocery pickup and delivery. Designed to minimize exposure risk for vulnerable community members while maintaining accountability and trust.

**This platform does not handle payments.** Recipients place and pay for their own grocery orders (pickup option), and volunteers simply deliver the items.

---

## Privacy & Trust Model

### Core Principles

1. **Recipient anonymity** — Recipients provide minimal identifying information. Real names are not required.
2. **Information revealed only when necessary** — Volunteers see recipient addresses only after claiming a delivery, and lose access upon completion.
3. **Volunteer accountability** — Volunteers are vetted before approval and their actions are logged.
4. **Audit without surveillance** — Logs track relationships and actions, not sensitive data.

### Recipient Data

| Field | Purpose | Visibility |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Display name (alias) | Shown to volunteers | Volunteers (on claim) |
| Delivery address | Delivery location | Volunteers (claim → completion only) |
| Phone/contact | Day-of coordination | Never directly shared; in-app messaging only |
| Pickup details | Store, order name, pickup time | Volunteers (on claim) |

### Volunteer Data

| Field | Purpose | Visibility |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Full name | Accountability | Admins; Recipients (on claim) |
| Photo | Identification at delivery | Recipients (on claim) |
| Email | Account access, notifications | Admins only |
| ID verification | Vetting (reviewed, not stored) | Admin only (temporary) |
| Self-attestation | Confirm not law enforcement | Stored as boolean |

### Vetting Process

1. Volunteer submits application (name, email, photo, service area, availability)
2. Volunteer uploads government ID and completes self-attestation checkbox
3. Admin reviews application and ID via admin dashboard
4. Admin approves or rejects; ID image is deleted after decision
5. Approved volunteers can claim deliveries

### Address Access Lifecycle

```
Request Posted → Volunteer Claims → ADDRESS REVEALED → Delivery Complete → ADDRESS HIDDEN
                                  ↓
                            (max 2 active claims per volunteer)
                                  ↓
                            Cancel → Address hidden, request returns to pool
```

### Data Retention

- **Active recipients**: Full data retained (address encrypted at rest)
- **Recipient-initiated deletion**: Address purged; tombstone record retained (recipient_id, associated volunteer_ids, last_active_date)
- **Auto-purge**: Accounts inactive 18+ months treated as deletion request
- **Delivery in progress during deletion**: Force-cancel, volunteer loses access immediately

### Audit Log

The audit log tracks **relationships and actions**, not sensitive data:

```
volunteer_id | recipient_id | action              | timestamp
-------------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------
5            | 12           | claimed_delivery    | 2025-01-15 09:30:00
5            | 12           | marked_complete     | 2025-01-15 11:45:00
```

If a volunteer is later reported, admins can identify which recipients they interacted with without the log itself containing addresses.

```

### Key Architectural Decisions

- **Polling for messages**: Frontend polls `/api/messages/<delivery_id>` every 10 seconds during active deliveries. Acceptable latency for coordination windows spanning 30-60 minutes.
- **Temporary file storage**: Volunteer ID photos stored temporarily during admin review, then deleted regardless of approval decision.
- **Address encryption**: Recipient addresses encrypted at rest using Fernet (symmetric encryption). Key stored in environment variable.
- **Single-tenant**: Each deployment is a separate instance with its own database. No multi-community logic in the data model.

> **Note for production deployments**: For true real-time messaging, consider upgrading hosting to support WebSockets (Flask-SocketIO) or using a service like Pusher. The polling approach is suitable for prototyping and small-scale use.

- MySQL 8.0+
- Git

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd community-delivery

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values:
#   - DATABASE_URL
#   - SECRET_KEY
#   - ENCRYPTION_KEY (generate with: python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())")

### Deployment on Render

1. Create a new Web Service connected to your repository
2. Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set start command: `gunicorn app:app`
4. Add environment variables (DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY, ENCRYPTION_KEY)
5. Create a MySQL database (Render offers managed MySQL, or use PlanetScale free tier)
6. Update DATABASE_URL to point to your production database

### For Other Communities

To deploy this for your own community:

1. Fork this repository
2. Follow deployment instructions above
3. Customize branding in `templates/` and `static/`
4. Update contact information and any region-specific content
5. Create your admin account
6. Share volunteer application link with your vetting organization
7. Share recipient registration link through trusted community channels

---

## Security Considerations

- **HTTPS required** in production (Render provides this automatically)
- **Address encryption key** must be kept secure; rotation requires re-encryption of all addresses
- **Session security**: Use secure, HTTP-only cookies
- **ID photos**: Ensure temp directory is not publicly accessible; implement cleanup job
- **Rate limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting to prevent abuse (Flask-Limiter)
- **SQL injection**: Use parameterized queries (SQLAlchemy handles this)
- **CSRF protection**: Enable Flask-WTF CSRF protection on all forms

---

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real-time messaging via WebSockets
- [ ] SMS notifications (Twilio integration)
- [ ] Mobile-optimized PWA
- [ ] Volunteer scheduling/calendar integration
- [ ] Multi-language support (Spanish priority)
- [ ] Delivery route optimization for volunteers with multiple claims
- [ ] Integration with grocery store APIs for order status
